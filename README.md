# TouchDesigner Export Movie Test

These are the files accompanying a short [Youtube tutorial found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdHCwjrAH1o).

## Setup

Open `ExportMovie.toe` in TouchDesigner and export 2 videos using the Export Movie dialog. Export one of them using the Animation codec and another using the H.264 codec. Import those 2 videos into the TouchDesigner file.
